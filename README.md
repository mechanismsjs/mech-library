# mech-project

Mechanisms are plugins for open source.

This project is here to get you started in making new mechanism libraries.

    $ git clone git@github.com:mechanismsjs/mech-library.git library

Where 'mech-library' will be the name of the new mechanism library you are creating.

If you want to add mechanisms to one of the existing libraries please fork that library (see [Mechanisms Home][mech-home-link] for existing libraries).

## What to do?

Anywhere you see the word 'library' replace it with your library name.

Anywhere you see mechanism01 ... mechanismnn replace the code with your own mechanisms.

Be sure to update your information in the package.json: Your github organization and your personal information.

Use the Example Documentation below to describe your mechanism.
