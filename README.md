Mechanisms are plugins for open source.

This project is here to get you started in making new mechanism libraries.

    $ git clone git@github.com:mechanismsjs/mech-library.git library

Where library will be the name of the new mechanism library.

If you want to add mechanisms to one of the existing libraries please fork that library.

## What to do?

Anywhere you see library replace it with your library name.

Anywhere you see mechanism01, mechanism02 ... mechanismnn replace the code with your own mechanisms.

Be sure to update your information in the package.json: Your github organization and your personal information.
